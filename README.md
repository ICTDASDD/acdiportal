## About ACDIMPC PORTAL

The WebApp will act as the Container or Core of all the application within the cooperative. It will allow us to centralize data, design consistently, increase security, monitor and implement user roles, and make best use of implementations. Generally, all applications developed under this platform will be labeled as:

- WebApp - the core system, it unifies all the apps within the cooperative.
- Department App or Top Management App - the system that focuses on department specific function (tasking, monitoring, etc).
- Interconnected App - system that are co-related to other department, individual or other system.

## APP SCOPING

- It is important to identify the category into which each application will fall before developing or upgrading it.
- Implementing an effective Sofware Paradigm is a must.
- Development full/complete documentation. Recommend to use third party platform for all project monitoring.

## Development Prioritization

The developer should develop the WebApp before developing other systems. As a result, future development can adapt to the app's pattern or template. WebApp will also function as both core and container for all upcoming development within the cooperative.

After The development of the WebApp, Departamental and Top Management App should follow. By doing so, developers can create platforms that have unique functionality compared to other departments.

And finally after developing the WebApp and Identified which department will be using it tru Department App we can now start the development of Interconnected App (ex: AHRIS, DMS, DSB, etc.)
